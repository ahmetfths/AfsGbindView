# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the AfsGbindView repository on GitHub for maximum impact and professional presentation.

## 🚀 Initial Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click "New" or go to `https://github.com/new`
   - Repository name: `AfsGbindView`
   - Description: `Interactive MM-GBSA trajectory visualization tool for computational chemistry`
   - Choose Public (recommended for open source)
   - Initialize with README: **NO** (we have our own)
   - Add .gitignore: **NO** (we have our own)
   - Choose a license: **NO** (we have MIT license)

### 2. Upload Your Code

```bash
# In your local AfsGbindView directory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AfsGbindView v2.0.0"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/AfsGbindView.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 📝 Repository Configuration

### 1. Repository Settings

Go to your repository settings (`https://github.com/yourusername/AfsGbindView/settings`):

#### General Settings
- **Description**: `Interactive MM-GBSA trajectory visualization tool for computational chemistry`
- **Website**: Add your deployment URL (if any)
- **Topics**: Add relevant tags:
  - `computational-chemistry`
  - `molecular-dynamics`
  - `mmgbsa`
  - `streamlit`
  - `data-visualization`
  - `python`
  - `chemistry`
  - `bioinformatics`

#### Features
- ✅ Wikis (for additional documentation)
- ✅ Issues (for bug tracking)
- ✅ Sponsorships (if you want donations)
- ✅ Preserve this repository (for important projects)
- ✅ Discussions (for community support)

#### Pull Requests
- ✅ Allow merge commits
- ✅ Allow squash merging
- ✅ Allow rebase merging
- ✅ Always suggest updating pull request branches
- ✅ Allow auto-merge
- ✅ Automatically delete head branches

### 2. Branch Protection Rules

Set up branch protection for `main`:

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

### 3. GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to host documentation:

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `main` / `docs` folder (if you create one)

## 🔧 GitHub Actions Setup

The CI/CD pipeline is already configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It will:

- ✅ Test on multiple Python versions and operating systems
- ✅ Check code quality with flake8 and black
- ✅ Run security checks
- ✅ Build and test Docker images
- ✅ Create releases automatically

No additional setup required - it works out of the box!

## 🏷️ Release Management

### Creating Your First Release

1. **Tag your version**:
```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0: Multi-ligand comparison and enhanced features"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

2. **Create Release on GitHub**:
   - Go to Releases → Create a new release
   - Choose tag: `v2.0.0`
   - Release title: `AfsGbindView v2.0.0`
   - Copy description from CHANGELOG.md
   - Attach any binary files if needed
   - Publish release

### Future Releases

For future releases, follow semantic versioning:
- `2.0.1` - Bug fixes
